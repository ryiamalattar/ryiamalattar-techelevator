# Lecture Code Walkthrough

To start, create a new project with the Vue CLI:

```shell
vue create vue-product-reviews
```
When prompted, choose the default project.

Next, walk the students through the new project you created, starting with the `src` folder. The `src` folder is where all of the component code lives. Components live in the `components` folder. Each component is put into its own file that ends in a `.vue` extension.

Make a new file there called `ProductReview.vue`. Add HTML to the top:

``` HTML
<template>
    <div class="main">
        <h2>Product Reviews for {{ name }}</h2>

        <p class="description">{{ description }}</p>
    </div>
</template>
```

This is the HTML of the component - the display to the user. When the component is included the `template` tags won't be included, but everything inside the `template` tags will be. The curly brackets signify One-way Data Binding. 

Next, you'll create data properties that hold the values you want to show in those spots. The curly brackets tie the values of those properties to those elements.

Add the JavaScript section:

```JavaScript
<script>
export default {
  name: 'product-review',
  data() {
    return {
      name: 'Cigar Parties for Dummies',
      description: 'Host and plan the perfect cigar party for all of your squirrelly friends.'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

This defines your Vue JavaScript Object. Everything after the `export default` is a JavaScript object that holds all the data properties and methods that the component uses.

Here, you've defined a name for the component, `product-review`, and data properties that you data bound to the view.

> #### Warning::`data()` must return an object
>
> One thing to point out to students is that the data method on the Vue object must return another object that holds the data properties. This is because every component needs to have its own data properties. This is a standard pattern that they'll always use for a component's `data`.

Finally, add the following CSS:

``` CSS
<style scoped>
div.main {
  margin: 1rem 0;
}
</style>
```

This is the component's default style. This is where you put anything that works with the component's layout or look.

> #### Vue Snippets
>
> With the Vetur Extension, you have access to some snippets that make creating single file components a bit easier. Create a brand new component and type `vue`. You should see a list of suggested snippets. The `vue with default.vue` gives you the template, script, and CSS blocks, which makes creating Single File Components (SFC) easier.

That's all you need for a working component.

You can now add the new component to a page by adding it to the main `App.vue` component. This is the component's parent component.

``` HTML
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <product-review></product-review>
    <img alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
    <HelloWorld msg="Welcome to Your Vue.js App"/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld.vue'
import ProductReview from './components/ProductReview.vue'

export default {
  name: 'app',
  components: {
    HelloWorld,
    ProductReview
  }
}
</script>
```

To make this page look nicer, add a `max-width: 800px` and some margins so that it doesn't hit the top of the page and auto to center align the component. All you need to focus on is the last two styles; everything else was generated by the CLI.

```css
#app {
  font-family: "Avenir", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 60px auto 0 auto;
}
```

If you run `npm run serve`, you'll see your component at the top of the page. It has the product name in a larger `h2` tag and the description underneath that. Inspect the code and show how the component's HTML has been added to the DOM.

> #### Removing the HelloWorld Component
>
> If you want to remove the boilerplate code that's generated, you need to do the following: remove the HelloWorld component from the template, and then in the script block, remove the import statement and HelloWorld from the components block.

## More complex component with Data Binding

Now that you have a simple component up and running, make it handle reviews on the book as an array of objects. Add this to the component's data:

``` JavaScript
data() {
    return {
        name: 'Cigar Parties for Dummies',
        description: 'Host and plan the perfect cigar party for all of your squirrelly friends.',
        reviews: [
            {
                reviewer: "Malcolm Gladwell",
                title: 'What a book!',
                review: "It certainly is a book. I mean, I can see that. Pages kept together with glue and there's writing on it, in some language.",
                rating: 3
            }
        ]
    };
}
```

If needed, feel free to add more objects to that array as well. Talk about how these objects are just JavaScript objects that the students have seen before.

Next, go to the HTML portion of your component and add the following HTML under the book details:

``` HTML
<div class="review" v-for="review in reviews" v-bind:key="review.id">
    <h4>{{ review.reviewer }}</h4>
    <div class="rating">
        <img src="../assets/star.png" v-bind:title="review.rating + ' Star Review'" class="ratingStar" v-for="n in review.rating" v-bind:key="n"/>
    </div>
    <h3>{{ review.title }}</h3>

    <p>{{ review.review }}</p>
</div>
```

> #### Star.png
>
> The students need to copy star.png from the root of their project into `vue-product-reviews/assets/`.

You've seen most of this in the tutorial, but there are a few new things here. You use the `v-for` directive to loop through the reviews, but you also use `v-for` to print out the correct number of stars for the review. If you pass `v-for` an integer, it prints that element that many times.

You also use the `v-bind` directive to add a `title` attribute to each image. This shows that you can use logic in your `v-bind` to do more complex things than just put values into the attributes. (Hover over a star image to reveal the title.)

Finally, add some CSS classes to the component to layout the reviews better:

``` CSS
div.main div.well-display {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
}

div.main div.well-display div.well {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 15%;
    border: 1px black solid;
    border-radius: 6px;
    text-align: center;
    margin: 0.25rem;
}

div.main div.well-display div.well span.amount {
    color: darkslategray;
    display: block;
    font-size: 2.5rem;
}

div.main div.review {
    border: 1px black solid;
    border-radius: 6px;
    padding: 1rem;
    margin: 10px;
}

div.main div.review div.rating {
    height: 2rem;
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: top;
    margin: 0 0.5rem;
}

div.main div.review div.rating img {
    height: 100%;
}

div.main div.review p {
    margin: 20px;
}

div.main div.review h3 {
    display: inline-block;
}

div.main div.review h4 {
    font-size: 1rem;
}
```

## Adding Ratings with computed properties

Now that you have the reviews showing, add some boxes to the top of the reviews list that shows how many reviews the list contains. You want to use your data to fill in those fields at the top. 

Since you already have all the review data, you can make computed properties to show how many of each review type you have. You already know how many 1-star reviews you have because you have the reviews. If a new review ever gets added, you want that number to also update programmatically, hence the computed properties.

First, add sections to the top of the page that reserve space for these properties to be shown. Add this below the description:

``` HTML
<div class="well-display">
    <div class="well">
        <span class="amount"><!-- data binding goes here --></span>
        Average Rating
    </div>

    <div class="well">
        <span class="amount"><!-- data binding goes here --></span>
        1 Star Review
    </div>

    <div class="well">
        <span class="amount"><!-- data binding goes here --></span>
        2 Star Review
    </div>

    <div class="well">
        <span class="amount"><!-- data binding goes here --></span>
        3 Star Review
    </div>

    <div class="well">
        <span class="amount"><!-- data binding goes here --></span>
        4 Star Review
    </div>

    <div class="well">
        <span class="amount"><!-- data binding goes here --></span>
        5 Star Review
    </div>
</div>
```

You can fill these values in by using `computed` properties. `computed` properties are properties that are calculated off of `data` properties, but then that calculation is cached to speed up the component. If the underlying data ever changes, the property is computed again. These are often called derived properties in other languages.

So create a `computed` property for the average rating. For this, add up all the review ratings and then divide that by the number of reviews:

``` JavaScript
computed: {
    averageRating() {
        // Use reduce to get the total of all the ratings
        let sum = this.reviews.reduce( (currentSum, review) => {
            return currentSum + review.rating;
        }, 0);

        // Divide by the number of reviews
        return sum / this.reviews.length;
    },
}
```

`computed` properties are just functions that return the value you want. You can then use them as you would normal `data` properties, as shown below:

``` HTML
<div class="well">
    <span class="amount">{{ averageRating }}</span>
    Average Rating
</div>
```

Then you can add these kinds of properties for each review count as well:

``` JavaScript
computed: {
    numberOfOneStarReviews() {
      return this.reviews.reduce((currentCount, review) => {
        return currentCount + (review.rating === 1);
      }, 0);
    },
    numberOfTwoStarReviews() {
      return this.reviews.reduce((currentCount, review) => {
        return currentCount + (review.rating === 2);
      }, 0);
    },
    numberOfThreeStarReviews() {
      return this.reviews.reduce((currentCount, review) => {
        return currentCount + (review.rating === 3);
      }, 0);
    },
    numberOfFourStarReviews() {
      return this.reviews.reduce((currentCount, review) => {
        return currentCount + (review.rating === 4);
      }, 0);
    },
    numberOfFiveStarReviews() {
      return this.reviews.reduce((currentCount, review) => {
        return currentCount + (review.rating === 5);
      }, 0);
    }
}
```

> #### Methods
>
> There's some code duplication here, and there is a way to refactor this using something you haven't looked at yet - methods. 

Now, you can use those new `computed` properties in your UI, also showing an example of toggling the 's' on reviews if the number of reviews is 1 or not:

``` HTML
<div class="well">
    <span class="amount">{{ numberOfOneStarReviews }}</span>
    1 Star Review{{ numberOfOneStarReviews === 1 ? '' : 's' }}
</div>

<div class="well">
    <span class="amount">{{ numberOfTwoStarReviews }}</span>
    2 Star Review{{ numberOfTwoStarReviews === 1 ? '' : 's' }}
</div>

<div class="well">
    <span class="amount">{{ numberOfThreeStarReviews }}</span>
    3 Star Review{{ numberOfThreeStarReviews === 1 ? '' : 's' }}
</div>

<div class="well">
    <span class="amount">{{ numberOfFourStarReviews }}</span>
    4 Star Review{{ numberOfFourStarReviews === 1 ? '' : 's' }}
</div>

<div class="well">
    <span class="amount">{{ numberOfFiveStarReviews }}</span>
    5 Star Review{{ numberOfFiveStarReviews === 1 ? '' : 's' }}
</div>
```

Now they've seen `computed` properties and how to create aggregated data from existing component values.

## Favorites

Finally, add a new checkbox to the review, under the description:

``` HTML
<p>Favorite? <input type="checkbox" v-model="review.favorited"/></p>
```

This connects directly to a `favorited` data property on the data. Add that data property to all the reviews in the list, defaulting them to false.

> #### Two-Way Data Binding
>
> You can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. This is Two-Way data binding because when the input is updated, the data property is updated and when the data property is updated, the input element is updated.

Use that `favorited` data property to toggle a class on the review. You can use the `v-bind` directive to set new classes on the `class` attribute. You can use this in combination with the existing classes that are already on the `div`. Add a new CSS class:

``` CSS
div.main div.review.favorited {
    background-color: lightyellow;
}
```

Then, go to the review `div` and add the data binding. For classes, add a new `v-bind` directive for `class` that describes an object where the key is the class to be added, and the value is a boolean that says whether the class should added or not.

``` HTML
<div class="review" v-bind:class="{ favorited: review.favorited }" v-for="review in reviews" v-bind:key="review.id">
```
